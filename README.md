# Anchor Wood Floors
www.theanchorwoodfloors.com 
<h1> Concept:
<h3> Anchor Wood Floors is an existing company owned by a friend who was in need of a website for his business. This was a static website build just to crack the
<h3> surface and have some sort of internet presense. 
<h1> Technologies Used:
<h3> HTML
<h3> JavaScript
<h3> SCSS
<h3> React Router
<h3> TailwindCSS
<h3> Heroku

<h1>Approach:
<h3> After several discussions with my friend about the services he provides, I was given a list of things to include on the webpage. There was no 
<h3> discussion on layout or functionality just yet... Just pretty much, get some stuff on the web that was presentable and got the point across
<h3> and get his phone number out there.

<h1>Development Plan
<h3> Design a clean, easy to use, straight to the point static website.
<h3> Get all the images I would need to give the page some life 
<h3> Learn TailwindCSS

<h1> MVP
<h3> React Router
<h3> Learned TailwindCSS
<h3> Deployed online to private domain to the public
<h3> One GitHub commit per class day


<h1>Stretch Goals
<h3> Become comfortable with TailwindCSS
<h3> Create a site that as I become better with CSS and backend, I can turn this site into a dynamic webpage with a contact input and database to store info.

<h1>Challenges
<h3> It was like working with a real life customer. Meeting standards, tracking them down for additional information, and relying on them for material that
<h3> that needed to put on the site.
<h3> Also. Attaching my code through Heroku to a privately owned domain was more difficult than I anticipated.
